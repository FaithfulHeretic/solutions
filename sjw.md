Combat bad ideas based on their underlying values, not their superficial manifestation.

The bad idea that must be effectively and thoroughly refuted is this.

    Value feelings more than individual freedom 

Define "Social Justice Warrior" and "Politically Correct Authoritarian" as a victim of this bad idea.

Understand how SJW's have weaponized language so you can properly defend yourself.
Don't let others control the meanings of your words.
Choose what you mean, be articulate, precise, and consistent.
Do not concede to authority when it comes to what a word means.

Remember we are not trying to defeat victims of bad ideas, we are trying to save them.
This is very difficult for the leaders, as they have immense psychological pressure to not change their mind from their followers.
The followers are mentally trapped by feelings of righteous indignation. 
Focus on values first, then expose hypocrisy.

Never apologize for offense.
Offense is not yours to give, it can only be taken.
