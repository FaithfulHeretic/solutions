# Refuting bad ideas

Don't let them take away your speech by convincing you to surrender your language.
Racists will redefine racism to be about power and privilege rather than race in order to rationalize their racism.
Violent thugs will redefine violence to be about not using their gender pronouns in order to rationalize their violent actions.
These are cowards who can't compete on the level of ideas, so they use redefinition as a tactic to justify their victim narrative while behaving in racist and violent manners.
