Actually looking into alternatives now that your company has taken a pro-censorship stance.  I am not a neo-nazi, so I sure as hell don’t approve of censorship, even if it is censoring a neo-nazi.

It may seem to you like you are doing the “right thing” by denying the general public the opportunity to decide for ourselves what is acceptable and what is not on the internet, but there are some points you should consider.

Do you think it is more likely to cure someone of a bad opinion by censoring them, or discussing with them why you think their opinion might be wrong?
How can anyone know whether an opinion is wrong if that opinion is censored?
Is censorship more similar to fighting bad ideas, or is it simply a digital version of the book burnings of the 1930s?
How can people with bad ideas be challenged or refuted if censorship pushes them into an ideological echo chamber where they feel oppressed, further confirming what they already believe?
How can good people with good ideas defend their good ideas skillfully if censorship denies them the ability to even know what the counter arguments are?

Maybe free speech has lost its appeal as society has taken it for granted, so it could be that censors like you will win.  Perhaps all of your competitors, such as amazon web services, will embrace censorship as well.  It may reach the level of the ISP, relegating what happens to be perceived as a cultural norm to an immutable dogma that can no longer be effectively questioned.  Perhaps those who want to hear the arguments and think for themselves will be isolated and lone.

But what if your wrong?  What if censorship is not favored by the majority, and it just seems like that because of media elite hysteria?  What if you are handing a competitive advantage to new platforms, such as difficult-to-censor blockchains.  There are upcoming social media sites, such as gab.ai and minds.com, that offer free speech alternatives to sites where free thought is regulated by censorship, throttling, and shadow banning.  Do you think anyone will remember the name of the sites that were on the side of censorship once the need for free speech has been fulfilled?  How much further do you think can you push your “correct” ideological views through censorship before your name is tarnished as an anti free speech advocate?

Keep this in mind, with the rise of anti-free speech authoritarians such as Google, Twitter, DigitalOcean, and Antifa, attention to the battle against censorship is rising.  You might want to take a principled stance running a business rather than policing speech, and take pride in letting people debate ideas with words instead of violence, instead of trying to be the moral arbiter of what is goodthink and what is crimethink.
