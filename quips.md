Offended is not oppressed

Maintain certainty proportional to evidence

There should be no "cultural rights" because cultures are not individuals

Treating a "hate crime" differently than a "crime" demonstrates government overreach from legitimate protective use of force, to the tyrannical criminalization of thought.

Combating a bad idea by obscuring an opponents argument makes the opposition more dangerous, as potential future victims of that bad idea can not hope to build defenses against it.

It is impossible to end racism without criminalizing thought, so the goal should be to minimize the role race plays in opportunity.

In the current climate
political correctness is just another word for censorship
identity politics is just another word for bigotry

There is nothing more dangerous than a bad idea.  A bad person can only wreak so much destruction without help.  With a bad idea, masses of well meaning, intelligent people can be summoned to a single destructive design.

The idea that "feelings are more important than freedom" is the most pernicious and must be refuted to prevent the death of #freespeech.

### Stephen R. C. Hicks, Free Speech & Postmodernism, page 23
- We should not be teaching our students the following lesson: "He called you a racist name. That victimizes you."  That lesson says, first, that you should judge your skin color to be significant to your identity, and second, that other people's opinions about your skin color should be significant to you.  Only if you accept both of those premises will you feel victimized by someone's saying something about your skin color.
- What we should be teaching instead is that skin color is not significant to your core identity, and that other people's stupid opinions about the significance of skin color is a reflection of their stupidity, not a reflection on you.

If some have a bad reaction (offended) to peanuts (free speech) and others don't, we don't ban (censor) peanuts for everyone #freespeech

Concentrated power is not rendered harmless by the good intentions of those who create it.
- Milton Friedman

I do not believe that any two men, on what are called doctrinal points, think alike who think at all. It is only those who have not thought that appear to agree.
- Thomas Paine

Show me an issue proclaimed too sensitive to discuss, and I will show you an authoritarian using victim-hood to suppress facts. #FreeSpeech

The prevention of free inquiry is unavoidable so long as the purpose of education is to produce belief rather than thought, to compel the young to hold positive opinions on doubtful matters rather than to let them see the doubtfulness and be encouraged to independence of mind.  Education ought to foster the wish for truth, not the conviction that some particular creed is the truth
- Bertrand Russel

I identify as an individual, which is smaller than any minority on the progressive stack.  I therefore claim first priority for privileged treatment to compensate for my minority status.
