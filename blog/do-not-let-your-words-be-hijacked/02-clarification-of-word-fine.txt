Well let me clarify what I meant by "fine" in that context.
I meant it is fine in the sense that they should not be forced to use a more sensible definition through compelled speech, that would be illiberal.
It is not fine in the sense that I am not going to roll over and start using their definition, I am going to insist on using a sensible definition.
What I am arguing for is pushback against words being hijacked.
The liberal method for this pushback is to counter bad ideas with good ideas.
