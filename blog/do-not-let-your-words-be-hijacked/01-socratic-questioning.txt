The most reliable method I have found is Socratic Questioning.  For example.

Is the choice to immigrate illegally a race?
Is ones choice to follow a particular religion a race?
Did Barack Obama's power and privilege alter his race to white?

My endorsement of Socratic Questioning should not be taken to mean I agree with "The Republic", it is that I don't reject good ideas just because they happen to come from someone who also has a lot of bad ones.

The nice thing about Socratic Questioning is that it is harder avoid thinking when responding.
It is easy to reject a statement outright, but when something is phrased as a question, one has to think of an answer rather than just saying something in the form of "no you are wrong".
Even though some people can't be won over no matter how clearly their position is exposed as irrational, moving the discourse to a form that makes them look ridiculous is still valuable in that onlookers can still be influenced, or if the conversation is private, it makes the one with the irrational position less likely to spread that nonsense for fear of looking ridiculous.
