I think what we need is an “operational definition” or a manifesto rather than an identity.  An identity is vulnerable to the same types of corruption seen in atheism plus, black lives matter, feminism, and so on.  By choosing a term and assigning qualifying criteria, we can call out the corruptors by demonstrating how they don’t match the same description we apply to ourselves.  Do you think a collaborative effort on something like this is workable?  Here is what I have come up with so far.

Possible names
- Thought Provokers
- Classical Liberals
- Cultural Libertarians

Our common values are truth, justice, and freedom.

Truth
- Maintain certainty proportional to evidence
- Do not accept claims as true without sufficient evidence
- Do not reject claims as false once sufficient evidence is provided
- Value free speech above all, as it is the only way to put ideas to the test
- Opposed to dogmatism
- Challenging of orthodoxy

Justice
- Equal rights and opportunities for all beings with moral agency

Freedom
- Celebrate diverse outcomes spawned from individual agency
- Individual agency is not subject to the will of a collective, identity, or culture
- Getting offended is not being oppressed

Our conduct sets us apart

To promote truth
- We maintain certainty proportional to evidence.
- We are willing to provide positive evidence for our positive claims.
- We are willing to change our minds when presented with sufficiently convincing evidence.
- We do not claim something can not be known in spite of evidence that it can.
- We speak plainly, without orwellian word redefinition that obscures meaning
- We use the word “racism” to refer to judging people based on the color of their skin rather than the content of their character.  We do not add irrelevant requirements to make racist behavior escape the stigma of racism, because we do not like racism.
- We use the word “violence” to refer to physical harm.  We do not equate speech to violence in an attempt to justify censoring others.
- We do not want anyone censored, no matter how much we may disagree with them.  Bad ideas should not be silenced, they should be brought to the light, challenged, and ridiculed.
- We are not so cowardly we feel the need to dox people, or spread lies about them to their employer.
- We care about what is “real”, not about what you “feel”.

To promote justice
- We are opposed to government sponsored segregation
- We categorically reject identity politics

To promote freedom
- We hold all accountable for only their own actions.  Individual fans of ours may act against our wishes, and we are fine with that because we respect individual freedom.  You may choose to self-censor because of how our fans act.  That is your individual choice, no one is censoring you.
- We categorically reject political correctness
- We are not loyal to identities, anyone can be criticized for their individual actions, even those who share our values
